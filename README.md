# collaborativelegislation
This project is seeking to develop the first (that we can find) platform to create model legislation in a truly collaborative fashion.
All legislation will follow a staged approach. Each stage will have to act a platform in-and-of-themselves.
<br>Stage 1 - Reddit like idea proposal and up/down voting platform
<br>Stage 2 - Wiki to outline the details of the legislation competition. All of the finer point of the competition will be crafted here, as well as the amount of the monetary prize for the competition winner.
<br>Stage 3 - Crowdfunding will take place to raise the prize money which will be paid out to the winner of the legislation competition.
<br>Stage 4 - Competition for the best legislation (or non-legislative solution) to the problem proposed in Stage 1. Anyone and everyone can submit their proposed solution during this Stage.
<br>Stage 5 - Filtering of each submittal will be done first by matching proposals to the points outlined in the competition wiki. If a proposal does not satisfy the point of the competition, it will be disqualified. The second filter will e a legal one wherein the legality of a proposal will be considered.
<br>Stage 6 - Once there is a short list of proposals that have made it through the various filters, there will be a decision as to the final winner. There are 5 potential means by which the final winner can be selected.

Winner Selection Options:
  1. Liquid Democracy - anyone can vote, or they can transfer their someone else.
  2. Prediction Market - monetary bets are placed as to which one will win; smart money will be on the best solution.
  3. Sortition - random selection of 1,500 people vote to determine winner.
  4. Unu - anyone who joins the unu session will get a chance to pull for their favorite selection.
  5. Ad Hoc Commissioner Council - group of subject matter experts will select. how these experts are selected is undecided.
